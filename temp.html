While attuned to these wraps, your unarmed attacks deal magical damage for the purpose of ignoring resistance, and are converted into +1 magic weapons. As a bonus action, you can activate the wraps for 1 minute, extending the reach of your unarmed attacks to 10 feet as the water around you gathers into streams around your hands, lashing out at enemies at your command. Once used, this feature cannot be activated again until the next dawn.</p>  <p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;"> </p>  <p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11pt;">Additionally, while attuned to these wraps, you can cast the <span style="font-style:italic;">Shape Water</span> spell at will.</p></td></tr>
